# TODOS

## Done
- [x] Forever-stable Hugo blog: hugo.toml, layouts (baseof, list, single, header, isso), static/css/style.css, first post.
- [x] README, .gitignore, a11y (semantic HTML, aria-label on nav, focus-visible in CSS).

## Later
- [ ] Set Isso server URL in `layouts/partials/isso.html` (replace `https://isso.example.com/` with your instance).
- [ ] Add content at `/school-sheets/` and `/map/` or update `hugo.toml` params to point to external URLs.
