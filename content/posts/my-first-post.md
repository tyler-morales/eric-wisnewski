Hi Eric — this post is your quick guide to using this blog. No code required.

* * *

## What is this site?

This is your personal blog. When you publish a post here, it shows up on the main page and gets its own link that you can share. The site also has a **School Sheets** page and a **Map** page; those links are in the menu at the top.

* * *

## How do I write or edit posts?

You edit everything through a simple web editor called **Pages CMS**.

1.  Go to [**https://app.pagescms.org/**](https://app.pagescms.org/) and sign in with your **email**. (You’ll get a sign-in link sent to your inbox — no password needed. If you haven’t been set up yet, ask Tyler to invite your email address.)
    
2.  Open this site in the CMS and look for **Posts** in the sidebar.
    
3.  Click a post to edit it, or create a **new post** to write something new.
    

Each post has:

*   **Title** — what shows at the top of the post and in the list.
    
*   **Slug** — a short, URL-friendly name (e.g. `my-first-post`). Use lowercase letters and hyphens, no spaces. This becomes part of the post’s web address.
    
*   **Publish Date** — when the post goes live. Make sure you set a full date and time; the editor will save it in the right format.
    
*   **Featured Image** — the image used when the post is shared (e.g. on social media). Use an image you’ve already uploaded to the site’s media library.
    
*   **Body** — the main content. You can type normally, use the toolbar for **bold**, _italic_, headings, lists, and links. Type **/** in the body to see extra options (like inserting an image).
    

When you’re done, **save**. The site will rebuild automatically and your changes will go live.

* * *

## How do I add images?

*   **Featured image (for sharing):** In the post editor, set the **Featured Image** field to an image from the media library. Those images live under “Media” or “Uploads” in the CMS — upload new ones there if you need to.
    
*   **Images inside a post:** In the **Body** of the post, type **/** and choose something like “Insert image,” then pick from your uploaded images.
    
*   ![](/images/uploads/PXL_20250405_004250419.RAW-01.MP.COVER.jpg)
    

If someone has set up the site so that images are stored in a specific folder, new images you add through the CMS will be saved there. You don’t need to touch any files or folders yourself.

* * *

## What if something goes wrong?

*   **“Date is not a parsable date”:** Re-open the post in the CMS, click the **Publish Date** field, set the date and time again, and save. That usually fixes it.
    
*   **Build or publish errors:** Tell the person who manages the site (e.g. Tyler); they can check the build logs and the README for technical details.
    

* * *

That’s it. Write your posts in the CMS, add a title and a slug, set a date and optional featured image, and hit save. The rest happens automatically.
